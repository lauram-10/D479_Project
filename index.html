                <h2>About the Island</h2>
                <p>
                    Taniti is a small tropical island located in the Pacific Ocean, covering less than 500 square miles. 
                    Despite its modest size, the island features a diverse landscape that includes sandy and rocky beaches.
                    It also boasts a safe, compact harbor, lush tropical rainforests, and a mountainous interior that includes a small, active volcano. 
                    Taniti is home to an indigenous population of approximately 20,000 people. 
                    Until recently, the local economy relied primarily on fishing and agriculture, but a rise in tourism has begun to reshape its economic landscape.
